# LinkTree Generator

This project creates a polished LinkTree builder that runs entirely in the browser. Open `link.html` and you'll be greeted with a short welcome screen, a quick form and finally your styled LinkTree.

## Features

- Add, remove, and edit unlimited social links.
- Optional profile picture and custom name.
- Responsive design using Bootstrap and Font Awesome icons.
- Dark mode toggle.
- Data is saved in the browser so refreshing the page keeps your links.

## Usage

1. Open `link.html` in any modern browser.
2. After the welcome screen fades, fill in your profile picture, username, tagline and links.
3. Click **Generate My Linktree** to view your page.
4. Data is saved locally so refreshing the page will keep your links. Use the back button to edit again if needed.

Everything works locally with no server or sign-up required.

The design uses Tailwind CSS with a soft green gradient background. The form dynamically builds your LinkTree without any server.
